# jcoc611 Blog
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my [blog](http://blog.jcoc611.com), where I talk about general programming, and specific code/projects, and other generally interesting subjects.

Feel free to look around the code and posts within the repository. You will find the licensing terms in the file *LICENSE.md*.

If you want to contribute to the blog, either with a post, or with some new functionality, then fork the repository and send a pull request with your updates. I cannot guarantee all requests will be accepted though.

Happy coding,
Juan Camilo Osorio
